 # Welcome
 
 Hi, I am Can Taşpınar. This is an AR Whack a Mole game made with love and ARKit. I hope you enjoy while playing it.
 
 ### TIPS:
 
 * This Playground has been tested on 6th generation iPad.
 * **Full screen** and **landscape** modes are recommended for a better experince.
 * Red moles are the bad guys, you get **-50** points if you whack them.
 * This Playground has a **background audio**.
 * The game will get more challenging each time the background audio changes.
